    "Introduction: Background\n",
    "========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility across all scientific domains has long been a major problem. The common solution is to firmly capture all inputs, parameters, procedures, conditions, and environments and provide it as part of the presented results. Conceptually, this overcomes the main reproducibility issue of scientific research, but _applied fields_ typically come with additional (in a certain way even conflicting) requirement - _portability_ - in order to achieve (not only) _distributability_ of the particular ML solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this worksop, we focus not so much on the problems of the general scientific research but primarily on the practical aspects of delivering ML solutions."

    "* the logical model - the pipeline (code) - can be fairly portable across all the different layers\n",
    "* portability of the physical trained model is generally much more difficult across different architectures and/or different Python (ABI) versions; that can be achieved only with specific model algorithms (through the support of special formats like [PMML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_Model_Markup_Language) and [ONNX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Neural_Network_Exchange))\n",
    "\n",
